EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals heal from the emotional distress associated with traumatic experiences. According to research, EMDR therapy has been effective in treating PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in a relatively short amount of time, with some studies showing significant results after only a few sessions. The therapy involves following a therapist's finger or a pencil moving horizontally with your eyes while thinking about a specific traumatic event, which triggers bilateral reprocessing in the brain, similar to REM movement during sleep. The negative emotion associated with the traumatic event is expected to diminish after several minutes of bilateral processing.

To help automate the process, the EMDR Therapy Web App was created as a simple, self-administered tool that can be used offline. The app offers three types of sensory stimulations - visual, audio, and vibration - that can be used in combination to help enhance the effectiveness of the therapy. By moving a customizable ball horizontally on the screen, the app enables users to follow the ball with their eyes, which triggers bilateral processing in the brain. The app also includes audio and vibration stimuli that can be used in conjunction with the visual stimuli for an enhanced therapeutic experience.

The EMDR Therapy Web App was created to provide a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional EMDR therapy that requires a trained clinician to move a finger or pencil horizontally for eye tracking. By automating the process and combining different types of sensory stimuli, the app makes it easier for individuals to self-administer EMDR therapy on their own. It also offers a promising solution for those who do not have access to traditional EMDR therapy due to high costs or limited availability.

Overall, the EMDR Therapy Web App offers a simple and effective tool that can help individuals deal with traumatic experiences and associated negative emotions. The app has the potential to be a valuable resource for those who are unable to access traditional EMDR therapy or for those who prefer a self-administered approach.
